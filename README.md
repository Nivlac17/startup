# Lines of Light

[My Notes](notes.md)

This project is a simple grid art creator, where users will be able to draw pictures by filling in the grid squares with selected colors. The application will provide a blank grid canvas, color selection tools, and the ability to save artwork. The app will also allow other users to watch you draw, and include an option for them to comment on your artwork as you draw, making it possible to play games such as pictionary.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

### Elevator pitch

Art has inspired humans for countless generations. From the first cave drawings to todayâ€™s modern photography, pictures, paintings, and sculptures have shaped the way we think and feel. **Lines of Light** brings that same creative spirit into a simple, accessible digital tool. Using just a grid and a color palette, anyone can create pixel art, doodles, or even play Pictionary with friends on their phone or computer.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for selecting a picture, and one for drawing or watching someone draw.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, display of different pictures to view, drawing tools, display other users art, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
Login
Saving grid data
Loading grid data
- **DB/Login** - MongoDB to store users and their artwork. Secure login system with hashed credentials.
- **WebSocket** - As a user colors the grid, updates are broadcast to all other connected users in real time. A chat feature included for users to comment on an artist work.
